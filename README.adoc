== Summary

CubeShuffle aims to improve your card game cube shuffling by offering more control over the card distribution/randomness and/or increasing shuffling speed by combining digital and manual shuffling.
It is designed to be generic for all card games with a cube format but I, the developer, primarily play Magic The Gathering (unaffiliated).

== [#Distribution shuffle]#link:docs/distribution_shuffle.adoc[Distribution shuffle]#

A quick and easy shuffling method for cubes where cards can be assigned to and distributed based upon groups.
Offers good control over the predictability as it can be controlled from being completely random to evenly distributed.
Instructions on how to use it are available link:docs/distribution_shuffle.adoc[here].
