= Predictability and randomness

You may be asking why anyone would want to control the randomness.
Shouldn't the draft be completely random?
If you want to and it suits your cube, then I am not stopping you from complete randomness.
Use link:docs/distribution_shuffle.adoc[Distribution Shuffle] with 100% randomness for all piles to speed up a completely random cube shuffle significantly.

But most cubes don't actually want complete randomness.
You want to ensure that most deck archetypes are playable and run a low chance of them being ruined by chance, or worse bad shuffling.
(Though bad shuffling is significantly less likely when using CubeShuffle.)
This is why you never see sealed booster packs in MTG with just one card color as they are far from completely random but rather have controlled randomness.
It lends itself to a significantly better drafting experience.
